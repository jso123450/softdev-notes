Ideas

- bloginator + ajax
- some kind of thing to make your own playlist
  - stick in a music API like soundcloud, spotify
  - a "regex" type thing for music
  - rate/comment on music
- secret chatroom for a group of friends to see how well you know them
  - to access, need to enter a code
  - register: actual name, codename, interests
  - everytime someone posts a message to the group, then a notification is
    sent out to the people in the group to their registered email or w/e
  - the notifications are randomized to look like normal emails
    the notifications are related to the sender's interests
  - one chance to guess who somebody is in the chatroom
    if its wrong, you lose - a message appears in the chatroom saying 
    your actual name & codename
