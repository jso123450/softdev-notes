mySQL
   -> basics of SQL (& free)
   -> couuldn't  use it for something serious
      -> did not support some features, e.g. transaction

prostgress
   -> postgresql
   -> slow, but full version of SQL

& then a back&forth race to become the better free SQL

we'll be using SQLite 3

SQLite 3
   -> a standalone SQL library that implements SQL functionality
   -> create table doughnuts (type text, price real, qty integer);
   -> .schema doughnuts (describes it)
   -> insert into doughnuts values ("jelly",2.50,10);
   -> insert into doughnuts values ("glazed",3.00,20);
   -> insert into chocolate values ("chocolate",2.00,5);
   -> select * from doughnuts;
   -> select type from doughnuts;
   -> select type,qty from doughnuts;
   -> select * from doughnuts where qty > 5;
   -> select * from doughnuts where price > 2.2 and qty < 15;
   -> select * from doughnuts were rowid < 2;
   -> delete from doughnuts where rowid > 4;
   -> select * from doughnuts;
   -> update doughnuts set qty=qty-1 where type="jelly";
   -> update doughnuts set qty=qty-1;
   -> update doughnuts set qty=qty+10;
   drop table
